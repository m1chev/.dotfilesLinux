# BackUp of my main settings for Linux

## Storage of my essential configurations needed for initial start of GNU operating systems

  - bash
  - git
  - intellij
  - note
  - spacevim
  - vim

## Setup
  Install Stow:
  - Fedora
  ```
  sudo dnf install stow
  ```
  - Debian based distros:
  ```
  sudo apt install stow
  ```

  For more details about the commands use man:
  ```
  man stow
  ```
  To initially move and create symlinks from the target files/directories 
  first run and check the output from this command:
  ```
  stow --adopt -nvt ~ */
  ```
  Then remove the 'n' option if you are happy with the result:
  ```
  stow --adopt -vt ~ */
  ```
  To stow - create symlinks using 
  ```
  stow -vt ~ */
  ```
  To unstow - delete symlinks and return the files:
  ```
  stow --adopt -vDt ~ */
  ```
